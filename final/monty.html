<p class="intro1" style="border-radius: 20px; margin-right: 20px; padding-top: 30px; padding-bottom: 30px;">My dog's name is Monty, and he is a Pembroke Welsh Corgi. He was born on March 19th, 2022, and is turning 3 this year. On the left is a photo of him on his First Birthday. He came home on June 10th, 2022. He has many quirks and characteristics, which I will be talking about in this webpage.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;"><u>Monty's Weirdest Quirks</u></h2>
<div style="display:flex; align-items: center;">
<img src="images/monty4.jpg" style = "margin-left: 3%; width: 250px; height: 200px; border-radius: 10px; margin-bottom: 1%; filter: brightness(110%); padding-right: 1%;" alt="Monty">
<ol style="text-align: left; margin-right: 1%; background-color: rgb(234, 234, 234); border-radius: 10px; padding-left: 3%; padding-top: 1%; padding-bottom: 1%; padding-right: 1%;">
    <li><a>On walks, he sits in the middle of the road when another dog is coming his way. When the dog comes near him, he pounces playfully. We always have to explain to the other owner that he just wants to play!</a></li>
    <li><a>Despite being a corgi, he is an extremely picky eater. His food is an assortment of different wet and raw foods. He only likes certain types of kibble (as you can tell, he is also very pampered). Being a herding dog, he will also bark at anyone who comes near his food and guard it.</a></li>
    <li><a>Whenever Monty wants to play with one of us, he brings one of his soft toys and sets it next to us, indicating that he wants to play. This is a very recent habit that he picked up, but he does it almost every evening after he eats his dinner! On the left, there is an image of him doing this.</a></li>
