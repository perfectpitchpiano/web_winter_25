    <p class="activities1">Outside of school, I like to play the piano and have been doing so for around 8 years. I also like to sing and have been singing in Columbia Choirs of Metropolitan Seattle for around 3 years. Additionally, I participate in the debate team and math team at school and recently joined the robotics team. Last winter, I learned how to ski and really enjoyed it. I skiied this year as well, and hope to do so throughout high school!</p>

    <p class="activities1">In school, I have a large friend group, and we are all very supportive and kind to each other. I also have friends outside of school that I try to meet as much as possible. However, it is relatively hard to keep in touch, since we are all busy, but they are good friends and I still try to hang out with them at every opportunity.</p>
