    <h2>Welcome to the World of Classical Music!</h2>
    <h3>Where we get to explore the lives of different composers!</h3>
    <p>I will be talking about different major composers such as <span class="span1">Bach, Mozart, Beethoven, Tchaikovsky, Shostakovich</span>, and my personal favorite, <span class="span1">Chopin</span>. I will go into detail about their personal lives, what they are famous for, and their major works.</p>
    <p>I picked this topic because I am deeply interested in classical music, and these are some of the most influential composers of the classical music world, and are famous for many different reasons. I like learning about the multifaceted lives of different composers and educating my non-musician friends about them, which is why I chose to make a website on this topic.</p>
    <p>In this website you will also see <span class="span2">photos</span> and <span class="span2"> quick facts</span> about these various composers. Some facts include when they were alive.</p>

    <h3>A Special Feature - B2TSM!</h3>
        <p>There is a youtube channel called TwoSet Violin, and they were a comedy duo who were classical musicians. They recently quit youtube, and as their farewell project, they made an album featuring the classical composers, <span class="span1">Bach, Mozart, Beethoven, Tchaikovksy</span> and <span class= 
        "span1">Shostakovich</span> (unfortunately not <span class="span1">Chopin</span>...). To honor TwoSet Violin's 11-year journey, here is a link to their album with the songs talking about the life of these composers (and if you listen carefully, you can hear hidden pieces by them...)</p>
